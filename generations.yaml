    description: "The original Peugeot 508 was introduced as a joint replacement for both the 407 and larger 607, representing a more streamlined approach to Peugeot's sedan lineup. Available as a four-door sedan (with a fastback-like profile) and a five-door station wagon (SW), it featured relatively conservative but elegant styling with balanced proportions. Built on PSA's Platform 3, it offered improved efficiency and refinement compared to its predecessors. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included gasoline engines ranging from 1.6L to 2.0L and diesel options from 1.6L to 2.2L HDi, with a diesel-electric HYbrid4 variant added in 2012â€”introducing a through-the-road hybrid system with diesel engine powering the front wheels and electric motor driving the rear wheels. Transmission choices included manual, automated manual, and conventional automatic options. The interior represented a significant improvement in quality and design, with premium materials, a driver-focused layout, and available technology including a color head-up display, four-zone climate control, and a JBL premium audio system. A significant refresh in 2014 brought updated styling with a more vertical grille design aligned with newer Peugeot models, improved interior materials, and enhanced technology features. A long-wheelbase version was produced exclusively for the Chinese market. The first-generation 508 successfully established itself as Peugeot's flagship sedan, offering a compelling combination of comfort, efficiency, and premium features, though it faced the challenges of a declining sedan market as consumer preferences shifted toward SUVs."

    description: "The current Peugeot 508 features dramatically more distinctive styling departing from conventional sedan norms, with a sleek fastback design, frameless doors, and aggressive styling elements including fang-like LED daytime running lights and a bold front fascia. Built on PSA's EMP2 platform, it's available as a five-door fastback (technically a liftback rather than a conventional sedan) and a station wagon (SW). The exterior design prioritizes style over maximum practicality, with a low coupe-like roofline and muscular stance. Powertrain options include various PureTech gasoline engines (1.6L) and BlueHDi diesel options (1.5L to 2.0L), with the range later expanded to include a plug-in hybrid variant combining a 1.6L gasoline engine with an electric motor for a combined output of up to 225 horsepower and approximately 30-35 miles of electric-only range. The interior showcases Peugeot's i-Cockpit design philosophy with a small steering wheel positioned below the instrument panel, high-mounted digital displays, and distinctive toggle-style switches. Material quality represents Peugeot's most premium offering with advanced technology including Night Vision, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance systems. The high-performance Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) variant introduced in 2020 features a more powerful plug-in hybrid system combining a 1.6L turbocharged engine with two electric motors (one per axle) for a total system output of 355 horsepower, creating Peugeot's most powerful production car. The second-generation 508 positions itself as a design-focused alternative to conventional D-segment competitors and premium brand offerings, emphasizing style, technology, and driving dynamics while acknowledging the segment's declining sales by focusing on distinction rather than maximum market share."
